# Troubleshooting IT Helpdesk Ticket Scenarios 

## Use Spiceworks or Jira to generate the tickets. Make sure to get approval by the Manager alwasys before working on the tickets. 

### Scenario 1:
- I’m a new admin assistant that started today. I need calendar, contact access to Kevin calendar. I will need to scan business cards and import them into his contacts. Please provide access asap.

#### How to handle:
- For this ticket, go to Outlook. Then go to account settings after clicking on File. From there, click on Delegate access. Add the right person and make sure to only delegate access to Calendar and Contacts. Click on Ok and it's done.

### Scenario 2:
- I accidentally deleted a file from the share drive. Can you restore it?

#### How to handle:
- For this ticket, go to the shared folder's properties (the folder where the file got deleted from). Then go to Previous Versions. From there, you can open up the file directory and add it back.

### Scenario 3:
- I need to run Macabacus on excel but it requires admin rights. Can you please install it?

#### How to handle:
- For this ticket, simply download and install Macabacus. Make sure to download the correct version. Go to 'About Excel' to find what version you need. Once it's installed, Excel should automatically load Macabacus once it's opened.

### Scenario 4:
- I’m a software developer that just started today. I need admin rights on my computer. Can you grant me admin rights?

#### How to handle:
- In the search bar look for Computer Management. Go to the file location first. Now, hold Shift and then right-click on Computer Management. Enter your admin credentials. Then go to Local Users and Groups. From there, go to Groups and double click on Administrators. Then add the person in the group.

 ### Scenario 5:
 - I have a meeting tomorrow. Can you install zoom on my computer?

#### How to handle:
- For this ticket, simply download and install zoom. Once the zoom installer is downloaded, click on 'Run as different user' and enter your admin credentials.
